PHP Framwork and along with some addons
=================

Contains the following:

Code Ignitor:  http://ellislab.com/codeigniter <br>
Data Mapper:  http://datamapper.wanwizard.eu/<br>
I also found a template tutorial somewhere that I added to this, however I forgot write down where I found it.<br>
<br>
JavaScript<br>
I wrote some custom form validation that still needs some work, but is just a start and did what it needed for the project.  I will probably break it out at some point.<br>
Other JS<br>
jQuery & jQuery UI<br>
font-awesome<br>
and more stuff I probably forgot to mention.
